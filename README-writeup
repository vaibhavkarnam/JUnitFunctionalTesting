The test cases represent an exhaustive set of possible inputs the
user might give to the program. The inputs cover boundary cases and
equivalence classes. If invalid input is given to the program, then 
we check if the program either throws an exception or returns an error code.
For checking the error code, we verfiy if the error code for invalid inputs is
consistently returned. If the program passes all the other test cases and 
either the test cases for the exception or error code check passes, then we can
accept this implementation.

for the sqrt function the test suite validates the upper bound of the input 
which is MAX_VAL for int and lower bound which is 0. There are a few tests 
within the equivalence class. Also, it tests if the values above the upper and
below the lower boundary return exception or error code. Thus if the function passes all the
boundary and equivalence class tests and one of the exception or error code tests
then we can accept the implementation.

for the sqr function the test suite validates the upper bound of the input 
which is 46340 for int and lower bound which is -46340. It also tests the 
sqr(0) which is the lower bound output. There are a few tests 
within the equivalence class. Also, it tests if the values above the upper and
below the lower boundary return exception or error code. Thus if the function passes all the
boundary and equivalence class tests and one of the exception or error code tests
then we can accept the implementation.

for the factorial function the test suite validates the upper bound of the input 
which is 12 for int and lower bound which is 0. There are a few tests 
within the equivalence class. Also, it tests if the values above the upper and
below the lower boundary return exception or error code. Thus if the function passes all the
boundary and equivalence class tests and one of the exception or error code tests
then we can accept the implementation.

for the sumUp function the test suite validates the upper bound of the input 
which is 65535 for int and lower bound which is 0. There are a few tests 
within the equivalence class. Also, it tests if the values above the upper and
below the lower boundary return exception or error code. Thus if the function passes all the
boundary and equivalence class tests and one of the exception or error code tests
then we can accept the implementation.

for the simpleFunctionXplusY the test suite validates the upper bound of the input 
which is MAX_VAL for int and lower bound which is MIN_VAL.It also checks wether the sum of the
two inputs is not above MAX_VAL and below MIN_VAL There are a few tests 
within the equivalence class. Also, it tests if the values above the upper and
below the lower boundary return exception or error code. Thus if the function passes all the
boundary and equivalence class tests and one of the exception or error code tests
then we can accept the implementation.

for the despacer function the test suite validates the boundary condtion where there are 
no single contiguous spaces, one single contiguous spaces and many single contiguous spaces.
It also validates invalid input like null. It also checks for empty string and string with only 
spaces. Therefore if the function passes all the tests then we can accept the implementation

Therefore if the program passes all the above tests as mentioned and one of the exception or
error code tests,then it can be accepted else it has to be rejected.
